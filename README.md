# Hunger Warrior

Hunger Warrior is a web application dashboard that facilitates safe and legal food distribution. Hunger Warrior will overcome the obstacle of navigating food safety laws, by vetting the food before it is delivered. This will take into account food safety laws in tandem with inventory management practices. Hunger Warrior provides value to both the grocery stores and shelters. For grocery stores, it provides a better waste management system for their food items that are about to expire or be thrown out. Hunger Warrior also provides a tracking service to participating grocery stores by logging food donations to use for tax incentives and exemptions. The Hunger Warrior service is not only beneficial to grocery stores, but also beneficial for the shelters because they will be able more easily acquire food items from reputable sources.
