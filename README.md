## Hunger Warrior 

Hunger Warrior will be a web application dashboard that will facilitate safe and legal
food distribution. Hunger Warrior will overcome the obstacle of navigating food safety laws, by
vetting the food before it is delivered. This will take into account food safety laws in tandem
with inventory management practices.
Hunger Warrior provides value to both the grocery stores and shelters. For grocery stores,
it provides a better waste management system for their food items that are about to expire or be
thrown out. Hunger Warrior also provides a tracking service to participating grocery stores by
logging food donations to use for tax incentives and exemptions. The Hunger Warrior service is
not only beneficial to grocery stores, but also beneficial for the shelters because they will be able
more easily acquire food items from reputable sources. This allows for the shelters to further
minimize costs of buying food and costs of maintenance.
